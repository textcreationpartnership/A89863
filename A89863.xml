            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN my laſt I promiſed to ſend you by the next an account of the proceedings and reſolutions of the Army, together with their intention and determination concerning their neerer approach towards your City: I have here ſent you an exact Narrative of
<pb facs="tcp:160298:3"/>
the whole buſineſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The Generall hath declared to the <hi>London</hi> Committee, that the Army intends no evill againſt that renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned City, no violation to the priviledges of Parliament, nor to be Agitators in any thing which may prove prejudiciall to the City, but deſire that their grievances formerly declared may be ſpeedily redreſled, juſtice executed, and the Kingdome ſetled, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Monday laſt in the afternoon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Aldermen and Common councell returned with an Anſwer from the Officers and Souldiers in the Army, to a Letter ſent from the Lord Mayor and Aldermen by the ſaid Committee, which was to this effect, That they may no longer be the diſ-ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of friends, nor the ſubject of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies malice.</p>
            <p>They as formerly, relate the cauſe of their not disbanding, and going for <hi>Ireland.</hi> 1. That the houſes be ſpeedily porged. That thoſe that have wronged them and the Kingdom may ſpeedily be brought to a tryall, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice executed upon them. Declaring, that very ſpeedily they will nominate ſome
<pb facs="tcp:160298:3"/>
members in the Houſe of Commons, who have vnjuſtly ſcandalized the Army, &amp; that they will proceed to particulars, in relation to their former actions.</p>
            <p>They further deſire, that the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and his Royall poſterity may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their rights, declaring alſo, that they ſhall be carefull of the preſervation of His Majeſties Royall perſon. This is the effect of the anſwer returned by his Excellency for <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> to the Committee of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen and Common-councel of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> ſhal now give you a hint or two of the preſent actions of the army, by ſetting forth their fair uſage to the Country people, and their gallant demeanour to all paſſengers whatſoever.</p>
            <p>One thing I had almoſt forgot (being a paſſage very remarkable) ſome particulars have been intimated for tender conſciences, without any licentious liberty to thoſe who live civil. His Excellency hath alſo declared that he cannot well remove his quarters 40 miles diſtance from <hi>London.</hi> Por the reſt, I refer you to the incloſed.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>UPon the cloſe of the fore going pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I received a Copy of ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain propoſitions, diſpierced amongſt the Souldiery, which came from <hi>Oxford</hi> (as ſome ſay) but not ſubſcribed by any hand or name a Copy of which I ſhall here preſent unto you as followeth:</p>
            <q>
               <floatingText xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>
                     <div type="propositions">
                        <head>Certain Propoſitions propoſed by divers Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts within the City of Oxford, to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery under command of his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax, concerning their preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt the City of London.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. That you will be pleaſed to take it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſerious conſiderrtion, the great danger that is likely to befall this poore Kindom, if once (again) involved in a ſecond warre, the ſword bath of late bin (almoſt drunk in bloud, which if once drawn again would have its full fill.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That ſome meanes may be uſed for a happy compoſure of all differences, now in diſpence betwixt the Honourable Houſes of Parliament aſſembled at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the
<pb facs="tcp:160298:4"/>
Souldiery under command of his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſir <hi>Thomas Fairfax.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Experience may tell you (if you do not know it) that wars are quickly begun, but not ſo ſoon ended, that it is dangerous to begin a new war, eſpecially with thoſe who have aſſiſted you in the late war againſt the common-enemy of the Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>But (indeed) it is ſaid, that the army wil not ſight againſt the City, unleſſe it firſt begin with them: if the City begin the Fight the City is undone: if the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Fight they are undone. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, revenge will fall from Heaven, upon that party that ſhall do ſo wickedly as to begin a new warre.</p>
                        <p>But it is hoped, (by us who pray for the welfare of our King and Country, and the peace and tranquility of this our Native Kingdome) that if the City and the Army ſhould be in the field neere each other, that they will be ſo wiſe as not to fight, but as friends to ſalute and embrace each other.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Conſider what a long and chargeable war the laſt was, with the loſſe of many thouſands of innocent ſouls, and yet few the
<pb facs="tcp:160298:5"/>
better, but all the whole Kingdome much the worſe Certainly no true-born Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (that wiſhes well to the peace and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his King and Country) would be ſo void of reaſon, as to be Inſtruments to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve their native Country in a ſecond war, but ſuch as have gotten by the old.</p>

            <p>Thus have I given you an exact account of the preſent proceedings in the Army, and one thing I can aſſure you, that the Souldie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are very unwilling to engage in a new warre; ſo that I hope, there will be a gallant compoſure of things betwixt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, City, and Army.
